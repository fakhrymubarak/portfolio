## Why Flutter?
I’ve been exploring multiplatform development while working on a portfolio website, which serves as my digital CV. My background includes experience with Flutter and Kotlin, so I decided to dive deeper into the world of multiplatform tools.

I started by experimenting with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), which is still in its alpha stage for web support. I built a simple project and deployed it to [https://fakhrymubarak.github.io/kmm-hello-world/pages](https://fakhrymubarak.github.io/kmm-hello-world/pages). However, when I tried accessing it on an iOS web browser, it didn’t work as expected. This setback pushed me to explore other options.

That’s when I decided to give Flutter a shot for this use case. With Flutter’s stable support for web, I created a similar portfolio website and deployed it to [https://fakhrymubarak.github.io/flutter-multiplatform/pages](https://fakhrymubarak.github.io/flutter-multiplatform/pages). To my relief, it worked perfectly across all platforms, including iOS.

This experience solidified my decision to use Flutter for creating my portfolio website. And so, here we are!
